        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring Product Manager with an undergraduate degree in Commerce, covering Accounting, Economics, Business, and Marketing: a combination that has equipped me with strong analytical thinking, financial literacy, and strategic market insight. Early in my career, I applied these skills in financial operations as an Accounts Payable Specialist for over three years. During this time, I developed a keen attention to detail that enabled me to identify problems quickly and propose effective solutions. This detail-oriented approach improved data accuracy and streamlined processes, making collaboration with C-suite leaders more efficient and impactful.</p>
        <p>My regular initiative to optimize workflows and drive continuous improvement kept me motivated and contributed to the success of the organization, the team, and our customers. I have also been responsible for training onshore teams, which strengthened my leadership and communication skills. My greatest strengths lie in cross-team collaboration and generating creative ideas to solve complex problems, skills that I continue to build in my current professional phase.</p>
        <p>Over time, I realized I have a strong passion for empowering brands to find and implement solutions that truly work for them while driving new innovations. I value fun, collaboration, and authenticity in every project and team environment I’m part of.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m pursuing an MBA at Seattle University alongside a Business Analytics certification to bridge my finance background with product management and data-driven innovation. Through hands-on projects—ranging from building a movie recommendation system to designing go-to-market strategies for new product rollouts—I’ve honed my abilities in user research, cross-functional teamwork, and transforming insights into impactful product solutions.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I recharge by engaging in creative activities and socializing, often hosting events where I enjoy brainstorming new ideas.</p>
