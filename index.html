    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m an aspiring Product Manager with an undergraduate degree in Commerce, covering Accounting, Economics, Business, and Marketing: a combination that has equipped me with strong analytical thinking, financial literacy, and strategic market insight. Early in my career, I applied these skills in financial operations as an Accounts Payable Specialist for over three years. During this time, I developed a keen attention to detail that enabled me to identify problems quickly and propose effective solutions. This detail-oriented approach improved data accuracy and streamlined processes, making collaboration with C-suite leaders more efficient and impactful.

My regular initiative to optimize workflows and drive continuous improvement kept me motivated and contributed to the success of the organization, the team, and our customers. I have also been responsible for training onshore teams, which strengthened my leadership and communication skills. My greatest strengths lie in cross-team collaboration and generating creative ideas to solve complex problems, skills that I continue to build in my current professional phase.

Over time, I realized I have a strong passion for empowering brands to find and implement solutions that truly work for them while driving new innovations. I value fun, collaboration, and authenticity in every project and team environment I’m part of. 

Currently, I’m pursuing an MBA at Seattle University alongside a Business Analytics certification to bridge my finance background with product management and data-driven innovation. Through hands-on projects—ranging from building a movie recommendation system to designing go-to-market strategies for new product rollouts—I’ve honed my abilities in user research, cross-functional teamwork, and transforming insights into impactful product solutions.

 Outside of work, I recharge by engaging in creative activities and socializing, often hosting events where I enjoy brainstorming new ideas.
